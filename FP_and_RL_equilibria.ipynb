This happens when during play, one of the action values drops bellow the threshold it can get increased by continuously getting a negative reward for its play. When that happens, this action will no longer be selected as the next action, unless it will be the maximum negative value. Even if it gets selected and played and the agent wins, the reward it will get, might not be enough to bring the value into positive state. In any case, the agent is trapped in playing the same move, the one with the greater value in its `q_table`. In other words, there's no guarantee it will converge to Nash equilibrium."

    "\n",
    "This evolution of Q-learning agent uses the `epsilon_decay` variable, a value by which the exploration phase decays. Moreover, this implementation has an `epsilon_threshold` variable which prevents the agent from getting stuck in playing the same action from its `q_table` forcing it to play a random move instead. This technique, somewhat prevents the agent resulting in negative values in its `q_table`."

To counter that, it tracks moves and maintains a distribution `self.pi` over it's available actions. In each round, the logic solves a linear program which tries to **maximize the expected utility** `self.V`, but finding the values for the distribution `self.pi`.\n",
